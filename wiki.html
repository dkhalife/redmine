<h2>1. Requirements:</h2>
<p>At this point, Work Timer requires a Windows installation with .NET Framework 4. Should the framework be outdated on your computer, the installer should give you details on how to update it. Aside from that, the application should work on any windows installation.</p>

<h2>2. How to install:</h2>
<p>First you will need to download the setup from sourceforge. After you run the downloaded file, a ClickOnce installation will start. It will download the software from my website and automatically install it so there is not much to do except verify that the installer is downloading from www.dkhalife.com and hit Install and you're good to go.</p>

<h2>3. Using the Work Timer:</h2>
<p>When you finish the installation process, a shortcut should be placed on your desktop and the program should also launch when done. This will open up the dialog shown in the screenshot. In order to get started all you need to do is specify a project name, the rate at which you are charging for is optional.
As soon as you set the project name, the <i>Start Timer</i> button should be unlocked.</p><p> Clicking that button, will minimize the program to the system tray and you will be able to see the current time simply by hovering over the application icon. Once you are done and want to stop, you can simply right click the icon and <i>Stop Timer</i> and the application will pop back up showing you the current time, and if you specified a rate, the current earnings will be displayed.</p>
<p>Now if you choose the same project name over and over (on separate occasions) the Work Timer will keep track of your total time spent on that project and your total earnings. Note that you can specify different rates every time even if you have selected the same project. To clear the total time and earnings, all you need to do is to click <i>Clear History</i>.</p>

<h2>Support:</h2>
<p>Should you have any questions or feature requests, or if you found a bug, please either use the tracker system to open a ticket and describe what you have in mind and i should take care of it asap.</p>
